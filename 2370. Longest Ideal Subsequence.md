# QUESTION: 2370. Longest Ideal Subsequence

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase letters and an integer k. We call a string t ideal if the following conditions are satisfied:

t is a subsequence of the string s.
The absolute difference in the alphabet order of every two adjacent letters in t is less than or equal to k.
Return the length of the longest ideal string.

A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

Note that the alphabet order is not cyclic. For example, the absolute difference in the alphabet order of 'a' and 'z' is 25, not 1.

## Example 1:  <br>
Input: s = "acfgbd", k = 2 <br>
Output: 4 <br>
Explanation: The longest ideal string is "acbd". The length of this string is 4, so 4 is returned. <br>
Note that "acfgbd" is not ideal because 'c' and 'f' have a difference of 3 in alphabet order. <br>

## Example 2: <br>
Input: s = "abcd", k = 3 <br>
Output: 4 <br>
Explanation: The longest ideal string is "abcd". The length of this string is 4, so 4 is returned <br>

# INTUTION:

- The solution utilizes dynamic programming to find the length of the longest ideal string efficiently.
- It iterates through the characters of the input string, updating the maximum length of ideal strings ending at each character based on the given constraints.
- By maintaining these maximum lengths dynamically, the solution avoids redundant calculations and efficiently computes the final result.


# APPROACH:

- Initialize a variable res to store the result.
- Create a vector t of size 26 to store the maximum length of ideal strings ending at each character.
- Iterate through each character in the string s.
- Calculate the index of the current character in the alphabet.
- Determine the range of characters within the absolute difference of k.
- Find the maximum length of ideal strings that can be formed by considering characters within this range.
- Update the maximum length of ideal strings ending at the current character.
- Update res with the maximum length encountered so far.
- Return res.

# COMPLEXITY:

## Time complexity: O(N)
## Space complexity: O(1)

# CODE:

```
class Solution {
public:
    int longestIdealString(string s, int k) {
        int res = 0;
        vector<int>t(26,0);
        for(int i = 0; i<s.size(); i++){
            int index = s[i]-'a';
            int left = max(0, index-k);
            int right = min(25, index+k);
            int maxLen = 0;
            for(int j = left; j<=right; j++){
                maxLen = max(maxLen, t[j]);
            }
            t[index] = max(maxLen+1, t[index]);
            res  = max(res, t[index]);
            
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
