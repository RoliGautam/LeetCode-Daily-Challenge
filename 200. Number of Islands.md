# QUESTION: 200. Number of Islands

Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 

## Example 1: <br>
Input: grid = [<br>
              ["1","1","1","1","0"],<br>
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],<br>
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],<br>
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]<br>
]<br>
Output: 1<br>

## Example 2:<br>
Input: grid = [<br>
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],<br>
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],<br>
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],<br>
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]<br>
]<br>
Output: 3<br>

# APPROACH:

- Define a Depth-First Search (DFS) function to explore connected land cells.
    - The function takes the grid, current row and column indices (i, j), total number of rows and columns in the grid as parameters.
    - Base cases:
         - If the current cell is out of bounds or is not land (has a value other than '1'), return.
         - Mark the current cell as visited (for example, using a special character like '').
    - Recursive steps:
         - Explore adjacent cells in all four directions (up, down, left, right) recursively.
- Define a function to count the number of islands:
    - Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of islands.
    - Traverse the grid using nested loops.
    - For each cell in the grid:
         - If the cell represents land (has a value of '1'), call the DFS function to explore the island starting from that cell.
         - Increment the counter after each DFS call, as each call represents a new island being explored.
- After traversing the entire grid, return the final count of islands.

  
# COMPLEXITY:

## Time complexity: 
O(M×N), where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns in the grid.
## Space complexity: 
O(M×N) in the worst case. This is because the DFS function can recursively call itself for each land cell in the grid, potentially leading to M×N recursive calls on the call stack.

# CODE:

```
class Solution {
public:
    
    void dfs(vector<vector<char>> & grid, int i, int j, int row, int col){
        if(i<0 || i>=row || j<0 || j>=col || grid[i][j]  != '1' || grid[i][j] == '$'){
            return;
        }

        grid[i][j] = '$';
        
        dfs(grid, i+1, j, row, col);
        dfs(grid, i-1, j, row, col);
        dfs(grid, i, j+1, row, col);
        dfs(grid, i, j-1, row, col);
    }
    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        int c = 0;
        int row = grid.size();
        int col = grid[0].size();
        for(int i = 0; i<row; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j<col; j++){
                if(grid[i][j] == '1'){
                    dfs(grid, i, j, row, col);
                    c+=1;
                    
                }
            }
        }
        return c;
    }
};
```
