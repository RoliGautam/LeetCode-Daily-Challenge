#  QUESTION: 950. Reveal Cards In Increasing Order

You are given an integer array deck. There is a deck of cards where every card has a unique integer. The integer on the ith card is deck[i].

You can order the deck in any order you want. Initially, all the cards start face down (unrevealed) in one deck.

You will do the following steps repeatedly until all cards are revealed:

Take the top card of the deck, reveal it, and take it out of the deck.
If there are still cards in the deck then put the next top card of the deck at the bottom of the deck.
If there are still unrevealed cards, go back to step 1. Otherwise, stop.
Return an ordering of the deck that would reveal the cards in increasing order.

Note that the first entry in the answer is considered to be the top of the deck.

# EXAMPLE:

## Example 1:
Input: deck = [17,13,11,2,3,5,7] <br>
Output: [2,13,3,11,5,17,7] <br>
Explanation: <br>
We get the deck in the order [17,13,11,2,3,5,7] (this order does not matter), and reorder it.<br>
After reordering, the deck starts as [2,13,3,11,5,17,7], where 2 is the top of the deck.<br>
We reveal 2, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [3,11,5,17,7,13].<br>
We reveal 3, and move 11 to the bottom.  The deck is now [5,17,7,13,11].<br>
We reveal 5, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [7,13,11,17].<br>
We reveal 7, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [11,17,13].<br>
We reveal 11, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [13,17].<br>
We reveal 13, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [17].<br>
We reveal 17.<br>
Since all the cards revealed are in increasing order, the answer is correct.<br>

## Example 2:<br>
Input: deck = [1,1000]<br>
Output: [1,1000]<br>

# INTUITION:

- We observe that after sorting the deck, we place the elements of the deck (after sorting) at positions like (0, 2, 4, 6, ...) in the output.
- Once we reach the end of the deck size in the result, the remaining elements are placed at the remaining positions, skipping one position at a time.

# APPROACH:

- Initialize variables i and j for tracking the deck and answer vector positions respectively.
- Take a boolean variable skip to maintain the decision of skipping the current position in our answer vector or not.
      - If skip is false: Don't skip the current position.
      - If skip is true: Skip the current position.
      - Flip the skip value each time we push the deck value to the answer vector.
- Create the answer vector and initialize it with zeroes.
- Sort the deck in ascending order.
- Iterate through the answer vector:
      - Fill the current position if it's empty and toggle skip to decide whether to skip the next position.
      - Move to the next card in the sorted deck.
      - Update the position in the answer vector.
- Return the Answer: Return the filled answer vector.

# CODE:

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> deckRevealedIncreasing(vector<int>& deck) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        bool skip = false;
        int n = deck.size();
        vector<int> ans(n, 0); 
        sort(deck.begin(), deck.end()); 
        while(i<n){
            if(ans[j] == 0){
                if(skip == false){
                    ans[j] = deck[i];
                    i++;
                }
                skip = !skip;

            }
            j = (j+1)%n;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
